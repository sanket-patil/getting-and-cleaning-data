Creating a Tidy Data Set out of the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset'
=========================

The objective of this project is to create a tidy data set from the  UCI Human Activity Recognition Dataset.

Contents of this submission
===========================
This submission includes the following:

- README.md
- An R script named 'run_analysis.R' that performs a series of transformations on the raw data and produces tidy data in the last step
- A text file called tidy_data.txt which is an independent tidy data set we created as part of this exercise.
- A code book file called CodeBook.md that provides details about the analysis we did and the variables.

Running the script
=================

To reproduce the tidy data set (tidy\_data.txt), simply source the file run\_analysis.R on RStudio: source("run_analysis.R")
We assume that the data directory (UCI HAR Dataset) is part of the working directory where you are going to run this script.
